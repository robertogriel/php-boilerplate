# Roberto Griel's PHP Boilerplate

![N|Solid](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-%3E%3D%207.4-blue)

## _Easily create an awesome new application from scratch with PHP_

I developed this boilerplate to help me to create new projects in PHP from scratch, so I've decided to put to public. Everyone can use.

## Includes:
- Lumen Microframework for your Routes
- Twig framework for view files
- PHPMailer for Mail functions
- ...and more will come soon, maybe.

## Installation

Just clone this repository and run with any PHP server (Xampp, Wamp, Docker, Built-in PHP Server). And so, run the composer update

```sh
git clone https://github.com/robertogriel/php-boilerplate
cd php-boilerplate
composer update
```

If some packages fails from composer download, just run the update command again.
